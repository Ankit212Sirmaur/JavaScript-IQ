/**
 * hoisting is js mechanism where variable and function both are hoisted differently means stored in the memory
 *  before the execution of the code i.e they moved to the top of the scope
 * 
 *  ðŸªœ it's a 2 step process
 *      - first initilazation like it is local or global scope
 *      - then second execuction
 * 
 *  ðŸ“Œ points to be remembered 
 *      - variable hoisted with undefined
 *      - function expression are hoisted as it is
